-- this script defines the behavior of a npc
-- warning all npc sharing the same behavior script will have the same local variables
-- i.e if you talked to a npc with this default behavior, all other npcs with the
-- same behavior script will give you the second dialog when you talk to them again

-- to create new behavior scripts, follow the same basic structure  (pls call them B_name)

Behavior = {}

local firstTime = true

-- function to set which dialog to play
-- must return a number corresponding to one of the dialog ids set in NPC Dialog Trigger
-- more dialog ids can be added by adding custom properties with the string type
function Behavior.getI(i)
	if firstTime then
		return 1
	else
		return 2
	end
end

-- function called when a conversation starts, useful to update variables
function Behavior.OnDialog()
	firstTime = false
end

return Behavior
